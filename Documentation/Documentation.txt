1. Load the Data 

     1.1 Load the excel file 'awesome_chocolates_data' into Power BI.

2. Data Modeling

     2.1 Connect the 'Geography' column from sales table with 'Geo' column from locations table.

     2.2 All other columns are mapped by the Power BI itself.

3. Total sales amount by Locations

     3.1 Create an measure for Total sales amount by using the below DAX formula
          
          3.1.1 Total Amount = sum(sales[Amount])

     3.2 Use the Stacked Column chart 

          3.2.1 Place the 'Geography' column from sales table in X-axis

          3.2.2 Place our created 'Total Amount' in Y-axis
		
          3.2.3 We got one bar named 'Blank' in the chart. So we have to transform the 'Geography' column

          3.2.4 To transform the column goto the Transform Data section in Home

          3.2.5. Reason for this error is some countries have extra space in front and last 

          3.2.6 Select the sales table and right click on 'Geography' column select Transform -> Trim 

          3.2.7 Click 'Close & Apply'

          3.2.8 Rename the title of the chart by Format Visual -> General -> Title

4. Add new page for analyzing the Sales person performace 

     4.1 Use table

     4.2 Add Sales person and Total Amount to columns in the order like Sales Person first and Total Amount at the last

     4.3 Remove the total because we are analyzing the Sales Person Performance so there is no need for their total sales amount. By Format Visual -> Search for 'Total' -> Turn Off the 'Values'
