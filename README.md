# Awesome-Chocolates-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

This repository contains the code and resources for a Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into sales data, sales team performance, and sales and customer base forecasts.

## Introduction

The Sales Analysis Dashboard is designed to help businesses analyze and visualize their sales data effectively. It provides key metrics, trends, and forecasts to facilitate data-driven decision-making. The dashboard is built using Microsoft Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool that allows for interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Usage

Once you have the Sales Analysis Dashboard set up, you can use it to:

- Analyze sales performance across different dimensions such as time, product categories, regions, etc.
- Evaluate sales team performance based on various metrics like revenue, targets, and conversion rates.
- Forecast sales and customer base using built-in predictive analytics features.
- Gain actionable insights by exploring interactive visualizations and drill-down capabilities.
- Export and share reports and insights with stakeholders in various formats.

## Data

The Sales Analysis Dashboard relies on a sample dataset for demonstration purposes. The dataset includes sales transactions, customer information, and other relevant metrics. You can find the sample data in the `data` folder of this repository.

If you want to use your own data, make sure it is in a compatible format such as CSV or Excel. Modify the data connections in Power BI Desktop to point to your data sources.

## Dashboard Pages

The Sales Analysis Dashboard consists of the following pages:

1. **Sales Analysis**: Provides an overview of sales performance, including revenue, units sold, and top-selling products.
2. **Sales Team Performance**: Visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) for the sales team, such as sales targets, individual performance, and team achievements.
3. **Sales and Customer Base Forecast**: Offers predictive analytics on future sales trends and customer base growth.
